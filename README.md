just_A_Little_Story... = 
"""Along the pace of typing onto my keyboard trying to program a simple "Hello World", 
I also take a step toward the new passion I've found in that simple line of code.

I was a shiftee from a medical field that cost me a year of doing something i'm slowly and surely getting tired of. 
I thought that I'll be forever in that field, draining myself for years of uncertainty and lack of passion. However,
I made a really life - changing decision by shifting to the field of Computer Science. Now, I can proudly say that I'm on the right track.
I know that life has always been a race, sadly.
However, there's no point in trying to win a race society has pushed me into if i'm not running for a future I dream of for myself.

As of today October 11, 2024, the day I updated my profile here on Github (with no repositories or even achievements I can proudly share YET), I am slowly
integrating myself into this field. I've been coding for the whole month already, without stopping, only little water breaks and cat petting time. I hope the future treats me well.
Regardless, I know I will be successful someday, surely in this field ^^ """

i'm_Interested_In... =
""" In terms of my major, since I only just started coding and only know simple concepts here and there, oblivious to those career's hardships, I still have a lot of fields i'm eyeing. I know I should be focusing on areas where I'm comfortable, where I excel, or where I'm passionate, as many have advised me, 
but there's no stopping a hopeful teen's curious mind. 

My first choice, as of the moment (10/11/2024), is to become a Full Stack Web Developer, with more focus on the front end. I really love designing. I've always been picky on every work I do, even taking me quite a few days of editing a photo of something that will only be seen by 200 people for 24 hours on my IG story. I'm aiming to make a website portfolio sooner or later to prove my skills to you guys ehe.
Stories aside, I just really find it interesting, especially since I follow a certain Filipino software engineer on YouTube named "Heremyas", and he really inspires me (ps. Follow him, please. I'd love to see him grow more!)."""

my_Love_Language = 
""" Hmmm, now that I think about it, I find a conyo speaking person hot, maybe it's my love language (jk). PYTHONNN! For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part. 
I'm still torn about which language I will learn next. The second semester of my major will 
focus on MySQL, but my friends say I should learn Java. Harvard's course also keeps bugging me to learn C, however my heart says HTML and CSS (PLEASE HELP ME DECIDE OR ELSE I'M GONNA S...). Totally fine with whichever I end up with since I'll learn all those someday anyway. """


I'LL UPDATE MY PROFILE FOR LIL UPDATES

Hello World, I'm Jhon Lloyd M. Valencia and I'm an aspiring software engineer. 

Just_a_little_story... : 
"""Along the pace of typing onto my keyboard trying to code a simple "Hello World", is also a step towards the new passion I've found in this world.
I was a shiftee from a medical field which costs me a year of doing something i'm slowly and surely getting tired of. 
I thought that I'll be forever in that field, draining myself for years of uncertainty and lack of passion. However,
I've made a really life changing decision, shifting to Computer Science field. Now, I could proudly say I'm in the right track.
I know that life has always been a race, sadly.
However, there's no point trying to win that race society have pushed me if i'm not running for a future I dreamt for myself.

Right now, October 11, 2024, the day I updated my profile here in github with no repositories or even proudly achievements I could share, I shall slowly
integrate myself in this field. I've been doing codes for the whole month already, without stopping, only little water breaks. I hope the future treats me well.
Regardless, I know I will still be successful someday. Surely in this field ^^ """

I'm_interested_in... :
""" Currently, since I only started coding and I only know simple here and there concepts, I still have a lot of fields i'm eyeing for.
I know I should only be focusing on areas I'm comfortable or where I excel or where I'm passionate per adviced by many, 
but there's no stopping a hopeful teen's curious mind.

Just_a_little_story... = 
"""Along the pace of typing onto my keyboard trying to program a simple "Hello World", 
is also a step towards the new passion I've found in that simple line of code.

I was a shiftee from a medical field which costed me a year of doing something i'm slowly and surely getting tired of. 
I thought that I'll be forever in that field, draining myself for years of uncertainty and lack of passion. However,
I've made a really life changing decision, shifting to Computer Science field. Now, I could proudly say I'm in the right track.
I know that life has always been a race, sadly.
However, there's no point trying to win that race society have pushed me if i'm not running for a future I dreamt for myself.

Right now, October 11, 2024, the day I updated my profile here in github with no repositories or even proudly achievements I could share, I shall slowly
integrate myself in this field. I've been doing codes for the whole month already, without stopping, only little water breaks and cat petting time. I hope the future treats me well.
Regardless, I know I will still be successful someday. Surely in this field ^^ """

I'm_interested_in... =
""" In terms of areas of my major, currently, since I only started coding and I only know simple here and there concepts oblivious of this career's hardships, I still have a lot of fields i'm eyeing for. I know I should only be focusing on areas I'm comfortable or where I excel or where I'm passionate, per adviced by many, 
but there's no stopping a hopeful teen's curious mind. 

My first choice as of the moment (10/11/2024) is being a Full Stack Web Developer, more focused on the front end. I really love designing, I've always been picky on every works I'm doing, even taking me quite a few days of editing a photo of something that will only be seen by 200 people for 24 hours on my IG story. I'm aiming to make a website portfolio sooner or later to prove it to you guys ehe.
Stories aside, I just really find it interesting especially that I follow a certain Filipino software engineer in youtube named "Heremyas", and he really inspired me (ps. Follow him please, would love to see him grow more)."""

My_love_language = 
""" Hmmm, now that I think about it, I find a conyo speaking person hot, maybe it's my love language (jk). PYTHONNN! For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part. I'm still torn to what language I will learn next. The second semester on my major will 
focus on MySQL but my friends say I should learn Java, harvard course also keeps bugging me to learn C, however my heart says HTML and CSS (PLEASE HELP ME DECIDE OR ELSE I'M GONNA S...). Totally fine whichever I end up with since I'll learn all those someday anyways. """


I'LL UPDATE MY PROFILE FOR LIL UPDATES
